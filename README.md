## Short Description
###### Commitly is a gamified habit-tracking app designed for users who try to be consistent in their personal or professional goals. Users can add and configure their habits (daily, weekly, or custom), track streaks, even receive reminders. Also users will be rewarded by earning XP points as they progress, so that users will be using the app in long term. Its standout feature — Team Streaks — allows groups of users to share streaks collectively as an addition, so they will feel accountable socialy and it will be harder to break streaks.

## Target Audience & Problem
###### Target Audience: General users — students, professionals, and anyone seeking motivation and something to push them to form consistent habits.
###### Problem Statement: Many people fail to sustain good habits due to lack of motivation, accountability, and progress visibility. Existing habit trackers often treat users as individuals, missing the motivational power of social commitment. Commitly solves this problem with team-based streaks and gentle gamification.

## Main Purpose
###### To help users stay consistent and motivated while building habits by combining progress tracking, reminders, and social accountability through team streaks.

## Core & Optional Features
### Type                                                  Features
###### Core (MVP)                                  Add/Edit/Delete habits · Configure daily/weekly frequency · Reminder notifications · XP system · Streak tracking · Team streak mode
###### Optional (Nice-to-Have)                     Badges · Community leaderboard · Social sharing · Firebase sync

## Platform & Technology
###### - Framework: Flutter (cross-platform mobile)
###### - Programming Language: Dart

## Data Storage Details
### Data Type                                              Description
###### Habit data                                       Name, description, frequency (daily/weekly), status
###### Progress data                                           XP points, streak count, completion history
###### Notification data                                       Reminder time and status
###### User data                                               Local profile ID, settings, (optional) Firebase UID for cloud sync

## Unique Selling Point (USP)
###### Team Streaks Mode – unlike typical habit apps, Commitly introduces collaborative streaks: if one member of a team breaks the streak, everyone’s streak resets. This fosters a sense of collective responsibility and motivation, blending social commitment with self-improvement.
